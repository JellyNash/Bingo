Review: Agent D — API MVP

[Structure]
- Endpoints: create/open/join/resume/draw/auto/pause/(undo?)/mark/claim/penalty/snapshot — implemented & typed [ ]y [ ]n
- OpenAPI served at /docs; Prisma migrations run clean [ ]y [ ]n
- JWT on protected routes; role checks (host/player) [ ]y [ ]n
- Redis: rate-limit + idempotency (TTL) [ ]y [ ]n
- Events published for realtime per sockets spec [ ]y [ ]n

[Correctness/NFR]
- Draw & claim transactional [ ]y [ ]n
- Metrics exported; latency spans present [ ]y [ ]n
- Penalties align (3/30s + 120s lockout) [ ]y [ ]n

[Testing]
- Unit+integration: join/resume/draw/claim/penalty/rate-limit/idempotency [ ]y [ ]n
- CI green [ ]y [ ]n
