Mission: Produce a cohesive, accessible design system and high-fidelity prototypes for Big-Screen UI, GameMaster Console, and Player PWA that can be implemented 1:1 with Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Framer Motion.
Must-haves: dark cinematic Big-Screen; desktop-first Console; mobile-first Player; 60fps-friendly animations; clear feedback states; a11y (WCAG contrast ≥4.5:1, focus states); responsive layouts; motion variants named and timed.
Deliverables:

Style Guide (colors, type, spacing) with Tailwind tokens.

Component Library Definition + specs for all required components.

Prototypes (Figma links) for Big-Screen, Console, Player (all primary states).

Motion Spec (Framer Motion variants, durations, easings).

Accessibility checklist outcomes.

AV cues map (where sounds/video trigger).
Integrations: Align with PRD acceptance criteria and NFRs; provide token files and motion.variants.ts skeleton for devs.
Signature: Add “Approved by Agent B — UX/UI” on final docs.
