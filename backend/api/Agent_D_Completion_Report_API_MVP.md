# Agent D — Completion Report (API MVP)

## Summary
- Delivered Fastify-based API fulfilling `contracts/openapi/bingo.yaml` for MVP game lifecycle, player flows, and moderation endpoints with Prisma/PostgreSQL persistence and Redis integration.
- Implemented auth, idempotency, rate limiting, transactional draw/claim logic, and realtime fan-out hooks aligning with orchestrator expectations.
- Wired observability (/docs, /metrics, OTel spans) and CI pipeline; added smoke script, Grafana placeholders, and unit/integration test coverage for critical flows.

## Endpoint List & Coverage
- Games: `POST /games`, `POST /games/{id}/open`, `POST /games/{id}/start`, `POST /games/{id}/pause`, `POST /games/{id}/resume`, `POST /games/{id}/draw`, `POST /games/{id}/auto-draw`, `POST /games/{id}/undo` (501 placeholder per MVP), `GET /games/{id}/snapshot`.
- Players: `POST /games/{pin}/join`, `POST /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}/resume`, `POST /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}/mark`, `POST /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}/claim`, `POST /games/{gameId}/players/{playerId}/penalty`.
- All handlers typed via zod validation/util mappers and instrumented with JWT role enforcement; realtime publish to Redis on draw/claim/snapshot updates.

## Migrations Summary
- Added initial Prisma migration `backend/api/prisma/migrations/20240919000000_init/migration.sql` creating core tables (games, players, bingo_cards, draws, claims, penalties, sessions, audit_log, rate_limits, idempotency_keys) plus enums; schema kept in sync with `db/prisma/schema.prisma` (added `autoDrawEnabled` boolean for toggle support).

## Redis Features
- Token-bucket rate limiting (`consumeRateLimit`) for join & claim with lockout (120s) on abuse.
- Idempotency cache (`idem:{key}` with 300s TTL) storing response payloads to dedupe join/claim submissions.
- Pub/sub publishers for draw, claim, and game-state channels to bridge Realtime service.

## Tests & CI
- Vitest suites (`tests/integration/*.test.ts`, `tests/unit/patterns.test.ts`) covering join 404 handling, cooldown enforcement, draw error handling, and pattern eligibility logic.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/api-ci.yml`) running install → lint → build → prisma migrate → vitest.

## Performance & Observability Notes
- Prometheus metrics via `/metrics` exposing `api_requests_total`, `api_request_duration_ms`, and `claim_validation_ms` histograms.
- OTel spans (`drawNumber`, `claim.validate`, `player.join`) instrumented using `@opentelemetry/api` for downstream tracing.
- Penalty policy enforced server-side: strike counter increments, 30s cooldown default, 120s rate-limit lockout.

## Open Points for Agents E/F/K/M
- **Agent E (Orchestrator):** Consume new `autoDrawEnabled` field and ensure socket listeners align with published Redis channels (`game:{id}:draw`, `game:{id}:claim`).
- **Agent F (DevOps):** Provision Redis persistence/monitoring for idempotency keys; confirm Docker Compose override integrated into main stack; seed secrets (JWT/HMAC) securely.
- **Agent K (Data/Analytics):** Map exported Prom metrics & trace spans into Grafana/OTel pipelines; extend dashboard JSON placeholder with final IDs.
- **Agent M (Security):** Review JWT secret rotation (currently env-based), confirm HMAC seeds storage policy, and validate rate-limit thresholds under adversarial scenarios.

## Change Log
- v0.1.0: Initialized API workspace, env configuration, scripts, Docker/CI scaffolding.
- v0.2.0: Implemented core services (Prisma, Redis, orchestrator adapter) and MVP routes with validation, metrics, and pub/sub events.
- v0.2.1: Added auto-draw toggle boolean, idempotency rate-limit integration, smoke script, Grafana placeholders, and Vitest coverage.

## Ready-for-Realtime Handoff
- Fastify server compiles, migrations applied, `/docs` and `/metrics` live, Redis pub/sub verified; README signed. API is ready for realtime integration and frontend consumption pending orchestrator finalization.
