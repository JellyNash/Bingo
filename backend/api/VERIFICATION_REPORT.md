# Agent D - API Server Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Status:** VERIFIED WITH ISSUES

## Executive Summary

Agent D API Server has been successfully built and tested against the 8-point verification plan. All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved (0 errors), and the server is operational. However, several issues were discovered during verification that require attention.

## TypeScript Fixes Applied

Successfully resolved all 10 TypeScript compilation errors:
- **cards.mark.ts** (5 errors): Fixed Prisma relation includes and type casting
- **penalties.apply.ts** (1 error): Added missing `appliedBy` field
- **idempotency.ts** (1 error): Fixed Redis set signature
- **orchestrator.adapter.ts** (3 errors): Created local type definitions

**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESS (0 errors)

## Verification Results

### 1. ✅ Align validators to schema (CUID vs UUID)
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Changed 7 route validators from UUID to CUID
- Files updated: snapshot.get.ts, games.open.ts, games.auto.ts, penalties.apply.ts, games.draw.ts, games.pause.ts, games.undo.ts
- **Issue Found:** Games are still being created with UUIDs despite CUID validators

### 2. ⚠️ Determinism smoke test
**Status:** COMPLETED WITH ISSUES
- Created test games successfully
- **Issue Found:** Game IDs generated as UUIDs instead of CUIDs (e.g., `b8d4b545-b7e3-4b71-bff2-0b000bed082b`)
- **Issue Found:** Different seeds producing same first number (both drew 63)
- Deterministic draw ordering appears compromised

### 3. ⚠️ Rate-limit and idempotency checks
**Status:** COMPLETED WITH ISSUES
- Rate limiting endpoint exists (/games/:id/draw)
- **Issue Found:** Redis syntax errors in idempotency service
- **Issue Found:** Idempotency key storage failing with "ERR syntax error"

### 4. ⚠️ Resume semantics test - Token inconsistency bug
**Status:** COMPLETED WITH CRITICAL BUG
- /resume endpoint exists
- **Critical Bug:** Token type mismatch in resume.ts:
  - Line 16: Verifies resumeToken as JWT
  - Line 28: Hashes same token to find session
  - Line 53: Generates new resumeToken as opaque token
- This creates inconsistent token handling between JWT and opaque tokens

### 5. ✅ Realtime bridging sanity check
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Uses Redis pub/sub for event distribution
- Events published to channel: `bingo:events`
- No WebSocket server implemented (uses Redis for bridging)

### 6. ✅ Auto-draw lifecycle test
**Status:** COMPLETED
- Successfully enabled auto-draw with 5-second interval
- Confirmed draws advancing automatically (sequence 1 → 8)
- Successfully disabled auto-draw
- Endpoint: POST /games/:gameId/auto-draw

### 7. ✅ OpenAPI sync
**Status:** COMPLETED
- OpenAPI spec available at: /docs/json
- Swagger UI available at: /docs/
- All endpoints documented with schemas

### 8. ✅ Evidence capture and tag
**Status:** COMPLETED
- This report serves as evidence
- All issues documented with specific file locations and line numbers

## Critical Issues Summary

1. **UUID/CUID Mismatch**: Database generating UUIDs while validators expect CUIDs
2. **Resume Token Bug**: Inconsistent token handling between JWT and opaque tokens
3. **Redis Syntax Error**: Idempotency service failing to store responses
4. **Determinism Issue**: Same numbers drawn for different seeds

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Fix Required:**
   - Fix resume.ts token handling consistency
   - Fix Redis syntax error in idempotency service
   - Ensure CUID generation in database for new games

2. **Investigation Required:**
   - Investigate determinism issue in PRNG seeding
   - Review orchestrator.adapter.ts for seed handling

3. **Testing Required:**
   - Add unit tests for token handling
   - Add integration tests for idempotency
   - Add determinism tests for card generation

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Build verification
pnpm build

# Create test game
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/games \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Game","maxPlayers":100}'

# Test auto-draw
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/games/$GAME_ID/auto-draw \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled":true,"intervalMs":5000}'

# Check OpenAPI
curl http://localhost:3000/docs/json
```

## Conclusion

Agent D API Server is operational with all TypeScript errors resolved. However, several runtime issues were discovered that affect core functionality. The most critical issues are the resume token inconsistency and the idempotency Redis error. These should be addressed before production deployment.
