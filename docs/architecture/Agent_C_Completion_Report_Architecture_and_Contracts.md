# Agent C — Completion Report (Architecture & Contracts)

## Summary
- Delivered end-to-end architecture blueprint for the Bingo platform, defining service topology, data flows, and resilience measures that satisfy PRD v1.0 and design intent.
- Produced implementation-ready assets: architecture RFC, Prisma schema, OpenAPI contract, Socket.IO event catalog, security/observability playbooks, and offline deployment guidance.
- Generated Phase 1 execution backlog (Agents D/E/F) aligned with updated React + Vite frontend stack, ensuring turn-key handoff to development teams.

## Artifact Paths
- Architecture RFC: `docs/architecture/RFC.md`
- Diagrams: `architecture/diagrams/c4-container.mmd`, `architecture/diagrams/c4-component.mmd`, `architecture/diagrams/seq-player-join.mmd`, etc.
- Data Model: `db/prisma/schema.prisma`
- REST Contract: `contracts/openapi/bingo.yaml`
- WebSocket Events: `contracts/sockets/events.md`
- Security Framework: `architecture/security/fairness-and-security.md`
- Observability Plan: `architecture/observability/`
- Offline Mode Guide: `architecture/offline/offline-mode.md`
- Integration Checklist: `handoff/integration-checklist.md`
- Phase 1 Tickets: `tracker/issues/generated_phase1_tickets.md`

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs
- **Frontend stack:** Standardized on React + Vite to align with Tailwind + shadcn/ui design system, chosen for fast HMR, strong ecosystem, and direct compatibility with Agent B’s deliverables. SvelteKit was discarded to avoid tooling mismatch.
- **Orchestrator architecture:** Implemented as an embedded Node.js library within API/realtime services for MVP simplicity, trading off microservice isolation for reduced latency and deployment complexity.
- **Realtime transport:** Socket.IO with Redis adapter selected to balance rapid development and horizontal scalability; native WebSockets considered but deferred to leverage Socket.IO’s reconnection semantics and namespace routing.
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL via Prisma for strong relational guarantees; Redis handles ephemeral state, rate limits, and pub/sub. Considered event sourcing but deemed overkill for MVP timelines.
- **Fairness model:** Cryptographic HMAC seeding for cards/draws ensures auditability with minimal overhead; storing signatures increases payload size but guarantees integrity.
- **Offline/LAN mode:** Docker Compose with mDNS advertising prioritized to meet venue requirements, accepting added DevOps maintenance for Avahi container management.
- **Observability:** Full OTel + Prom/Grafana stack specified despite MVP scope; ensures readiness for scale and troubleshooting at cost of initial setup effort.

## Open Points for Agents D/E/F/K/M
- **Agent D (Backend):** Confirm feasibility of microsecond timestamp handling across Prisma/PostgreSQL for claim arbitration; evaluate need for triggers or database constraints supporting audit hash chain.
- **Agent E (Frontend React):** Validate hydration strategy for Big-Screen static export with Vite; assess need for React suspense boundaries around Socket.IO contexts.
- **Agent F (DevOps):** Scope infrastructure for Redis Sentinel or cluster mode in production; plan certificates for HTTPS on bingo.local in venues where TLS is mandated.
- **Agent K (Data/Analytics):** Align telemetry event naming with analytics pipeline; ensure Grafana dashboards have data source mappings in target environment.
- **Agent M (Security):** Review JWT secret rotation cadence and offline storage of HMAC secrets; assess additional DDoS mitigation for public deployments.

## Change Log
- v1.0 (2025-09-19): Initial architecture RFC, contracts, schemas, observability, offline plan, and Phase 1 tickets published. Frontend containers originally referenced SvelteKit.
- v1.1 (2025-09-20): Updated RFC, diagrams, and tickets to reflect React + Vite stack; added React-oriented technical notes for Agent E tickets.

## Ready for Dev
All architectural assets are signed and synchronized with product and design requirements. Phase 1 tickets provide actionable scope for Agents D/E/F. Pending clarifications listed above, the system is ready for implementation kickoff.
