# Agent A — Completion Report (PRD v1.0)

## Summary
- Authored PRD v1.0 detailing personas, flows, rules, penalties, and NFRs aligned with architect (Agent C) and designer (Agent B) priorities.
- Populated acceptance criteria matrix with testable Given/When/Then scenarios and latency targets for each MVP user story plus supporting operational safeguards.
- Produced release plan spanning Phases 1–3 with measurable milestones, risks, and exit criteria tied to performance goals.

## Artifact Paths
- `docs/prd/PRD_v1.0.md`
- `docs/prd/acceptance_criteria_matrix.csv`
- `docs/release/release_plan.md`

## Open Questions / Assumptions for Agents B & C
- Agent B: Confirm animation pacing and accessibility treatment for claim cooldown states (countdown + audio cues) meet UX intents.
- Agent B: Validate Big-Screen media cue handling sequencing with upcoming OBS overlay refinements.
- Agent C: Review feasibility of 120s hard cooldown triggered by rate-limit strikes alongside 30s standard cooldown.
- Agent C: Confirm Redis Sentinel + AOF approach meets resilience expectations for LAN/offline deployments.

## Change Log
- Filled PRD_v1.0.md template with complete content, including quantified NFRs, penalty defaults (3 strikes/30s cooldown), offline constraints, and simultaneous claim policy.
- Authored acceptance_criteria_matrix.csv entries covering join, mark/undo, claim flows, resume, GM controls, Big-Screen, offline discovery, rate limiting, observability, and scale validation, each with performance targets.
- Completed release_plan.md with detailed milestones, success metrics, risks/mitigations, and exit criteria across Phases 1–3.
- Updated tracker meta issue checklist, pinned status, and due date to reflect completion.

## Ready for Review
Artifacts are finalized and ready for Agent B quality inspection and Agent C integration steps.
